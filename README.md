# we talking about backend and frontend how it work?
# Backend just like we use in the previous example we use fakejson to get data from it so we know that when frontend any thing from backend it request for it and due to this resquest backend response of it so we know that backend and frontend both are independent with each other . frontend did't knows its backend and same as backend.

# so when frontend request to backend this is duo to api calling and when frontend request to backend so the connection is built and when response reach to other side when these thing completed their connection will be cancel 

# so in this way stateless comes:
# STATELESS: when client request to server must contain all the necessary information and process the request .the server does't contain any client state between request ,so it mean every interation between clent and server are independent and server does not contain any request information 

# we talk about token why we use it why it is necessary we explain you with the of example we take example of chatGPT when you go this chatgpt website you seen the interface of chatgpt and their are many boot or ai are their you just read their description only and when we use it so it necessary to login it it 

# two more concept come PRIVATE & PUBLIC 

# in the public we just show limited things the user just seen the page they did't and action in it 
# in the private it is necessary to login first for the chatgpt where you can query on it in the private 
  # two more things comes AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION
  # AUTHENTICATION the user is valid they have identity to pass it 
  # and when it pass throught authentication next step is authorization to access     certain things   this is the example of RESTFULL architecture.
